# IBM Data Analysis Specialization Projects:

This repository is mainly for projects and notes related to the IBM Data Analysis Professional Specialization that I had undertaken.

This set of 9 courses were my first steps towards building a career as data analyst. Each one of them dwelt on fundamental issues, 
covering the day-to-day activities of a data analyst. From the very first tasks - such as exploratory analysis 
and web scraping - to concluding activities - such as visualizing data and delivering meaningful insights -, I have started to learn how to "see the forest for the trees" of data.
Also, given the overwhelming amount of information today, I learned the importance of clear and effective communication.
Hence, this IBM Specialization was a first step towards building a porftolio of projects - it helped me to start learning Python, its core data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib),
and to get a grasp of other tools such as SQL.


**Part 1 - Python for Data Science, AI & Development**
Subjects:
- Python Basics
- Python Data Structures
- Python Programming Fundamentals
- Working with Data in Python
- APIs, and Data Collection

**Part 2 - Python Project for Data Science**
This mini-course is intended to demonstrate foundational Python skills for working with data.
Subjects:
- Web Scraping - review of the following topics:
   1. Beautiful Soup Object
   2. Filter         
   3. Downloading and Scraping Web Contents

Projects:
- Extracting Stock Data using a Python Library ("Final Assignment Library")
- Extracting Stock Data using Web Scraping ("Final Assignment Webscraping")
- Final Assignment

**Part 3 - Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python**
This course dwelt on relational database concepts and how to apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. Besides using real datasets to learn how to use SQL, I also got acquainted with accessing databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python together.
Subjects:
- Connecting
- Querying
- SQLMagic
- Analysing
- Real Practice with Chicago Public Schools Database

Projects:
- Data Analysis of three datasets:
   - Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
   - Chicago Public Schools
   - Chicago Crime Data

**Part 4 - Data Analysis with Python**
Departring from Python fundamental, this course demonstrated how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and so on.

Subjects:

- Importing Datasets
- Cleaning the Data
- Data frame manipulation
- Summarizing the Data
- Building machine learning Regression models
- Building data pipelines

Project:
- This course was based on a simple question - how to define the price of a used car based on a series of variables? As such, this project encompassed several areas of data analysis. After scraping, exploring, and wrangling data, I leared how to apply simple predictive models to understand the corelation between different variables. I also learned basic differences between regression models and how to apply them to a particular project.

**Part 5 - Data Visualization with Python**
In this course, I learned how to use basic dataviz tools with Python while aiming at creating visualizations that make sense to people. Throughout the classes, I got acquainted with the following libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Dash, and Folium.

Subjects:
- Line Plots
- Area Plots, Histograms, Bar Charts
- Pie Charts, Box Plots, Scatter Plots, Bubble Plots
- Waffle Charts, Word Clouds, Regression Plots
- Maps (interactive, choropleth)

Projects:
- Maps and charts were plotted based on Canada's Immigration Rate Database. I identified main countries of immigration, and, by using different graphs, managed to understand different migration patterns and how they can be corelated with other factors.
- Designing a dashboard using Dash:
   - By using data on airflights in the US, I created a dashboard using different charts that updated according to the user's year and airline company.
