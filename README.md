# IBM Data Analysis Specialization Projects:

This repository is mainly for projects and notes related to the IBM Data Analysis Professional Specialization that I had undertaken.

This set of 9 courses were my first steps towards building a career as data analyst. Each one of them dwelt on fundamental issues, 
covering the day-to-day activities of a data analyst. From the very first tasks - such as exploratory analysis 
and web scraping - to concluding activities - such as visualizing data and delivering meaningful insights -, I have started to learn how to "see the forest for the trees" of data.
Also, given the overwhelming amount of information today, I learned the importance of clear and effective communication.
Hence, this IBM Specialization was a first step towards building a porftolio of projects - it helped me to start learning Python, its core data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib),
and to get a grasp of other tools such as SQL.
